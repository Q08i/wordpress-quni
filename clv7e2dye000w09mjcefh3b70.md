### A Lesson in Small Claims and Smaller Victories

#### Ah, Doc-O-Matic, the behemoth of the document management software world, where Rowan “Brad” Galvin was once a rising star in the realm of data analytics. But one day, out of the blue, Doc-O-Matic pulled a fast one and fired him, in a manner as illegal as downloading pirated software.

To add insult to injury, they held hostage his personal items: a laptop full of data models, a mug that said ‘I’m not a robot,’ and most egregiously, his beloved desk cactus named Sergio. “Enough is enough!” Brad proclaimed, rolling up his sleeves for a David vs. Goliath-esque battle in small claims court.

Brad set out, fully charged with analytical prowess, to fill out the labyrinthine court forms. These weren’t just forms; they were barely legible photocopies of photocopies of photocopies, like a game of legal “Telephone” gone horribly wrong. Some forms seemed like rejected riddles from a sphinx, while others he was cryptically advised not to fill out at all.

Finally, he approached the clerk’s counter. The clerk, who seemed like she’d been designed by the same programmers behind Doc-O-Matic’s glitchy software, stared at the forms, rubber-stamping them with the enthusiasm of a sloth on sedatives. “You didn’t fill this out right,” she droned.

Confused, Brad asked, “How should it be filled out?”

She shrugged. “No idea. That’ll be $280.”

“$280 to reclaim $100 worth of stuff?!” Brad paused, running a quick cost-benefit analysis in his agile mind. Was it worth it to fight over what was ultimately a $100 discrepancy? No, some battles aren’t worth fighting, even for a data wizard like Brad.

And so, Brad withdrew from the battlefield that day, conceding this one skirmish but taking with him an invaluable lesson. Sometimes, letting go is the best strategy, even for someone with a penchant for actionable plans and universal betterment.

And as for Sergio the Cactus? Brad got a new one and named it “Small Claims,” a constant reminder of the battles worth choosing. The end.
